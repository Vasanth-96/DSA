--linear search : it linearly iterates through loop and search element.
best = o(1)
average = o(n)
worst = o(n)

--binary search: it goes to mid element each time and checks if th element is less than or greater and decreses the range.
best = o(1)
average = o(logn)
worst = o(logn)

--jump search: it uses a jump size by rooting the size of array and at last loop over the step size
best = o(1)
average =  O(√n)
worst =  O(√n)

--interpolation : it uses some kind of line equation to evalute range and its random .
average = O(loglogN)

--exponential search: first finds the range, then apply the binary search on the range
best = o(1)
worst = o(log i ) i defines search key.
